# Depiglining

Depiglining aims to replicate the experience of speedrunning on 1.16.1 for later versions of the game.
It accomplishes this by reverting several nerfs from 1.16.2 and beyond.
The current features are as follows:

- Restores the [Piglin bartering loot table from 20w20a to 20w27a](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bartering/Outdated_loot_tables_in_Java_Edition#20w20a%E2%80%9320w27a)
  (including the full releases of 1.16 and 1.16.1) which had higher odds of obtaining ender pearls
- Prevents Piglin Brutes from spawning in structures (like Bastion Remnants)
  and removes them from the "Monsters Hunted" advancement criteria

The mod supports both Fabric and Forge. The former depends on Fabric API. No other mods are required.
